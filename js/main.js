// Pinball project breakdown and psuedo code

//Establish Game Canvas object
/* Game objects:
    Pinball
    Flippers
    Initial / Starting Lane
    Firing Pin
    Dead space 
 */

// Map firing pin and flippers to key presses  
      // determine if timeout's are needed 

// Establish collision detection 
  // pinball and flippers
  // pinball and firing pin
  // pinball and the game board
  // pin ball and the dead space

// Establish Collision movement / physics
  // pinball and collision walls 
  // pinball and collision with bumpers 
  // initial firing
  // motion / responsivitiy of the flippers

// have functioning pinball with flippers firing pin and some kind of object / interaction on board as Minimum Viable Product by Tuesday December 29 9pm PST
